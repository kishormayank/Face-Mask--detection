# Mask-detection

Here is the jupyter code for face mask detection project.
As Face-Mask became a major part in our lives in this CoVID-19 era, I built a fully functional model for detecting whether or not a person is wearing face mask.
All the code written here are my own.
The tools used are CNN,Computer vision and tensorflow as backend.

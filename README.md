# Face-Mask--detection

Here is the jupyter code for face mask detection project.
The dataset was too large to be uploaded.
The source paths used here is from my local system.
The idea behind this project was inspired from a you tube channel.
All the code written here are my own.
Some helps were taken from certain blogs and youtube
